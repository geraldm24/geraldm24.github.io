<center>#### How to Target an Audience for Importing Goods</center>

>Let's take a look at some of the companies with the highest stock values in the world. Microsoft a leader in technology was able to edge Apple in stock value according to [gfmag](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/largest-companies) by focusing on subsciptions rather than hardware sales. As an online business you might take notes. I want to know which countries have the top 20 percentages of their population working. And the top 20 price levels the country pays to import goods. Because if you're targeting the working class like Walmart you might want to be sure the country is paying a good price level to import such goods. I believe there would be a positive relationship between the countries with the top 20 working percentage rates with the top 20 import price levels. And the two list of the top 20's would have some countries that overlay.  


**Keeping** it simply I used a database from Kaggle. [source](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/penn-world-table#PWT.csv) Then I began to clean my data by removing null values. And filtering my data to get the top 20 from a specific column. I decided to use the import, and export price level columns because this told me how the company does business financially. Then I filtered my columns for more recent years because past years wouldn't be very helpful for the current price levels the countries pay.

**In order to test my hypothesis** I have to create a subset of my data so only the years I want 2011-2014 are listed in my top 20. From there I just put them in descending order by sorting values and that creates my ordered lists. To check if there is a possible correlation I must scale my columns because it standardizes them to make them comparable.AS you see below my scatter plot has the standardized plots of Population Working Rate, by the Price Level Paid for imports. As well as the mean to show the average Price Level amount from each country.  

**Testing** my first bar graph here shows the amount of countries to make the top 20 population working rate from 2011-2014. ![top20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geraldm24/geraldm24.github.io/master/img/labourbar.png) The countries in the top 20 had a rate from 60-76% rate of employment. Next I plot the top 20 Price Levels for Imports.<div>

</div> And I get about 70-80% of the US dollar. But more significantly I get Switerzland and China, Macao SAR to appear once again in the top 20. Out of the top 20 Price Levels for Imports we see 5 out of 20 are repeats from our employment rate bar graph. That's about 20 percent. So if we wanted to target countries that work and pay pretty high price levels these two countries would be a start. But my hypothesis states that my correlation between employment rate and import price levels would be about 70%. So next from my scale list I do a scatter plot of those two variables.![scatter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geraldm24/geraldm24.github.io/master/img/scatter.png) We see a positive correlation. But when I use the correlation method my result only show a 34% correlation between the two. As seen in my [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tBnA-d4BeIeTISoNzfKwieMrk1ZVUyNZ#scrollTo=_s2E59FHP4cq).

**In Conclusion :** My results are that there is some overlay between the 2 top 20 lists. Which would be good starters for analyzing what's which countries can we ship products to. However I have to reject my hypothesis that claims there would be 70% positive correlaton between the top 20 employment rate and the top 20 Import Price levels. The reason the overlap isn't much higher is probably because these two variables are a more independent than I thought.
