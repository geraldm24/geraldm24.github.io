#### PLENTY TABS OPEN
Spending hours staring at the computer screen does something different to your brain. You learn to google everything, and surely you recall code from scratch. All because you type it repeatedly and unfortunately you have yet to master for loops. And because of this experience I have my stepping stones to create a brief portfolio.  
Keeping it simply I used a database from Kaggle. [source](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/penn-world-table#PWT.csv)
**Possible scenario:** Say I'm a online business selling casual clothes as well as working gear and supplies. And I'm targeting countries with larger working proportions.
I want to know if there is a positive correlation between the working proportion of the country , and the price level they pay to import items.  As I want the big spenders. 
I first find the amount in years, in which the biggest fish can swim. 
It seems from 2005 to 2014 I get a result for just 3 countries.

The result is the top 20 proportions of working people in a population.

The two charts are from the same data just different visual supplements.
Now I want to see how much the top countries currently pay for imports.
So I do a filtered graph from 2011-2014, for the top 20 price levels countries paid.

Click on the chart above to see the interactive version. 
None of those countries appear from the first visual in the top lavishly paying countries. I must reject the notion that I can use the largest working population to target for my business, as they are not paying the top amount for imports. Maybe they are doing so well they can payless to bring items in, it can be many reasons why.
